# Coding Standards for Our Team

Our team follows strict coding standards to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability across all projects. Below are the key principles and guidelines we adhere to:

## General Principles

1. **CodeFlow:**
   - Maintain a logical and consistent flow of code to ensure clarity and simplicity.
   - Avoid overly complex structures; prioritize straightforward, easy-to-follow solutions.

2. **Clean Code and Clean Architecture:**
   - Write code that is self-explanatory and adheres to SOLID principles.
   - Avoid redundant comments; the code itself should be clear enough to understand.
   - Structure projects following clean architecture guidelines, with clear separation of concerns.

3. **Continuous Improvement:**
   - When working on maintenance or support tasks, always improve the code if possible.
   - Refactor outdated code to align with current standards whenever the opportunity arises.

## Localization

- While the code and comments are written in English, all output messages (e.g., logs, exceptions, and user-facing messages) must be in Portuguese (PT-BR).
  - Example:
    ```csharp
    Console.WriteLine("Operação concluída com sucesso!");
    ```

## Documentation and Comments

1. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Update documentation whenever code changes affect existing behavior.
   - Ensure new features and functions are documented thoroughly.

2. **XML Comments:**
   - Use XML comments to describe public methods, classes, and properties.
   - Include parameter descriptions, return values, and examples when applicable.
     ```csharp
     /// <summary>
     /// Calculates the sum of two integers.
     /// </summary>
     /// <param name="a">The first integer.</param>
     /// <param name="b">The second integer.</param>
     /// <returns>The sum of the two integers.</returns>
     public int Add(int a, int b)
     {
         return a + b;
     }
     ```

## Logging

1. **Relevance:**
   - Logs are critical but should only be added where they provide meaningful information.
   - Avoid excessive logging that clutters log files and reduces performance.

2. **Best Practices:**
   - Use log levels appropriately (e.g., Info, Warning, Error).
   - Include relevant context in log messages to aid debugging and monitoring.
     ```csharp
     _logger.LogInformation("Usuário {UserId} autenticado com sucesso.", userId);
     ```

## Code Review and Collaboration

1. **Peer Reviews:**
   - All code changes must be reviewed by at least one team member before merging.
   - Provide constructive feedback and suggest improvements where necessary.

2. **Branch Management:**
   - Follow the Git Flow guidelines outlined in our [Git Flow Document](GIT_FLOW.MD).

3. **Pull Requests:**
   - Ensure all pull requests include meaningful descriptions of changes and reference related issues.

By adhering to these coding standards, we can maintain a high level of code quality and foster a culture of continuous improvement within our team.
